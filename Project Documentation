Meditask - AI Tele-Rehabilitation Prototype
This project is a web-based prototype for Meditask, an AI-powered platform designed to revolutionize tele-rehabilitation for patients and clinicians.

🎯 Goal
The prototype demonstrates the core functionality of the Meditask platform:

Dual-Role Authentication: Separate login and sign-up for Patients and Doctors using Firebase Auth.

Real-Time Pose Analysis: Uses a patient's webcam and MediaPipe Pose to analyze a simple "Right Hand Raise" exercise.

Live Feedback: Provides immediate, on-screen feedback to the patient about their exercise form.

Clinical Data Logging: Securely saves exercise results and feedback to a Firestore database.

Doctor Dashboard: Allows doctors to log in, view their list of patients, and review detailed exercise history reports.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript

AI / Computer Vision: Google's MediaPipe Pose

Backend & Database: Firebase Authentication & Firestore

🚀 How to Run
Set up Firebase: Create a Firebase project, enable Authentication (Email/Password), and set up a Firestore database.

Configure: Copy your Firebase web app configuration object.

Paste Config: Open index.html and paste your Firebase config into the firebaseConfig placeholder object within the <script type="module"> tag.

Launch: Open the index.html file in a modern web browser (like Google Chrome).
